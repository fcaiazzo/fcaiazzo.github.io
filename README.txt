Personal Portfolio

To begin this project I created three html pages containing the basic framework that I desired for my own personal website. After the pages contained the content that I wanted, I worked to create Cascading Style Sheets that provided both a clean and readable website as well as an aesthetic that I felt reflected myself. I logged my progresses and changes using Git and checked my pages for validity using the given validators.
